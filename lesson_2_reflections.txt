What happens when you initialize a repository?

laptop2@LAPTOP2-PC ~/reflections
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in c:/Users/laptop2/reflections/.git/

a new folder is created (hidden) .git
 Why do you need to do it?

to keep track of changes . to original file

You may also wish to run git status after you have created the file.
 You should see that now both files are listed as untracked files.


$ git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        lesson1.txt
        lesson2.txt
        lesson_2_reflections.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

laptop2@LAPTOP2-PC ~/reflections (master)
